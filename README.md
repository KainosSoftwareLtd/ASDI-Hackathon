## Abstract

'Today, 56% of the world's population - 4.4 billion inhabitants - live in cities. This trend is expected to continue. By 2050, with the urban population more than doubling its current size, nearly 7 of 10 people in the world will live in cities.'

 Green spaces improve both the environmental and social conditions of cities, including air quality, population satisfaction and urban temperatures. Multiple datasets available through the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative can be used to recommend optimal locations for green spaces. We have extracted the raw data from each of these and combined them onto a dashboard that, hopefully, maybe useful to city planners to improve city environment and society.
